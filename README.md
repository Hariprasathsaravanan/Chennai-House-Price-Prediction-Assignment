# Chennai-House-Price-Prediction-Assignment
Introduction
This project focuses to predict chennai Area house prices for house buyers and house sellers.

The value of a house is more than just location and square footage. Houses have several features that make up it's value.We are going to take advantage of all the features to make accurate predictions about the price of any house.

We developed our project with logical steps to ensure that users can easily use the application and make accurate predictions.

1. Problem definition
We used a simple case study to understand the problem. There are two clients at the same time without a conflict of intreset.

The house buyer, a client that wants to buy their dream home. They have some locations in mind. Now, the client wants to know if the house price matches the value. With the application, they can understand which features are influence the final price. If the final price matches the value predicted by the application the can ensure they are getting a fair price.

The house seller, a client that buys houses, fixes them and then sells houses to make profit. This client wants to take advantage of features that influece the price of a house the most. They typically want to buy a house at a low price and invest in features that will give the highest return.

Operating enviroment
client/server system:windows
database: Excel,csv
platform: Python
Operating system: Windows
2. Gathering data
We found an online kaggle challange that contained the data we needed to solve the problem. Data was downloaded from here We broke everything into the following steps We started by loading data and packages we needed for the research.We then analyzed the data to understand the relationships between the price and other features. 

3. Cleaning the Data
After collecting the data from various sources,we need to start cleaning the data.There are some missing values,irregular format,irrelevenat datatype available in our dataset.
we need to start cleaning the data

4. Getting Insights from Data
After Cleaning the data completion,we need to interpret more column in the dataset and get some insights from the data.we need to perform correlation,covariance between multiple
column of the data and get some insights

5. Exploratory Data Analysis
We have to do Analyze the data and make visually presented format for all features of dataset.we have to do some analysis and visualization for every features of the dataset

6. Splitting the data
We need to split the data into Training and Testing dataset for Building the Machine Learning Model.

7. Building the Model
We need to build the Machine Learning Model for Regression using Machine Learning Techniques.

We were able to build a various Linear Regression Algorithm models that can predict the price of a house given certain features. some of the machine learning model will predict the house price with the accuracy of 99%.

4. Conclusion
There are real world problems that can be solved with machine learning. Some of these solutions can take real world data and make very accurate predictions that can be useful to our daily lives. Users can leverage the power of machine learning without being data scientist when easy to use applications are built around some of these complicated models.
